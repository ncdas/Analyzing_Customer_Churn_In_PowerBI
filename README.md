# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

# **Project Description**

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, I'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I'll answer these questions by creating **measures** and **calculated columns**, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.


# **Step 1: Exploratory Analysis**
In this step I'll perform Exploratory Analysis. Exploring the new dataset and revisit creating measures in Power BI to get a better understanding of why customers are churning. The following tasks will be performed throught the Explaratory Process: 
- Data Check. 
- Understanding Churn. 
- Calculating Churn. 
- Investingating Churn Reason. 
- Digging Deeper into Churn Categories. 
- Use Map.
